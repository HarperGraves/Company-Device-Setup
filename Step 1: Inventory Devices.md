- I grabbed what I needed to setup the iPads: iPads, Screen Protectors and Cases from the storage room. I wheeled them out safely with the cart. <br>
- After bringing them out, I put the Serial Number and the IMEI on the back of the iPads onto the Excel Sheet on the computer to copy them into it (all caps for the Serial Num. and IMEI).
